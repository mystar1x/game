Assets for the Shooting Gallery game for the C2Academy

* Graphics :
Kenney.nl Shooting gallery assets - http://kenney.nl/assets/shooting-gallery

I resized some of the elements from Kenney's assets pack to fit the power of two requirement.
I also made some points and font out of akaDylan's font on Dafont.com - http://www.dafont.com/fr/search.php?q=akadylan

using GIMP - http://www.gimp.org/
and blackhornet's SpriteFont generator - https://www.scirra.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=86546&start=0
